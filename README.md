### Shaun Lawrence

I am a passionate father, husband, gamer and imposter working in .NET, C#, WPF and Xamarin. I love to tinker with things be that software related or better still disconnected from any computer.

I actively maintain [Expressive](https://github.com/bijington/expressive) and use it in a number of personal/professional projects.

I wish I could direct you to a blog of some kind but I am not convinced I have either the skills nor the content...
